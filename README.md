# Optimal Filter Based Anti Surge Robust Controller with AMB Actuator
This project presents an overview of active magnetic bearing design for supporting turbomachinery suspension systems. This procedure will cover the design of mechanical architecture, optimal state estimation, and optimal control of an active magnetic bearing. Adopting an AMB as an actuator of anti-surge controller on industrial sized compressor requires two components, a thrust magnetic bearing (TMB), and a radial magnetic bearing (RMB). The axial clearance of compressor, which is important in surge prevention mechanism, is governed by the TMB. However, the TMB cannot operate properly without any support from the RMB to stabilize the rotor radial position at its nominal point. Therefore, it can be concluded that the role of RMB in this type of an anti-surge controller is as important as the TMB.
